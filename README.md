# ToDoApp

Desktop or mobile friendly app for writing down list items.

This uses LocalStorage to keep your data, and it requires the Crypto library to generate UUID's. To keep it simple, I imported TailwindCSS as a CDN, oh well. It also utilizes Font Awesome for a few icons. And, I used a seperate file for my custom color definitions.

Instructions should be pretty self explainitory, I tried to keep it super intuitive.

Thanks for checking it out!
